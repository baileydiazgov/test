# This is a Dummy Markdown File

This file serves as a basic example of how to structure a document using Markdown.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some common Markdown elements:

- **Headings:** Use `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
- **Emphasis:** Surround text with `*` or `_` for *italics* or **bold**.
- **Lists:** Use `-` or `*` for unordered lists, and numbers for ordered lists.
  - Sub-lists are indented with spaces.
- **Links:** Use `[Link text](URL)` for inline links.
- **Images:** Use `![Alt text](Image URL)` to embed images.

## Code Blocks

Use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks:

```python
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
